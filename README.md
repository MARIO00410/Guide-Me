#  Guide_me System

## Overview

The City Transportation Guide System is a C++ application designed to help users find the most efficient and cost-effective transportation routes between cities. This project leverages graph data structures to model the cities and connections between them, with features such as route finding, price calculation, and travel planning.

## Features

- **Graph Data Structure**: Cities are represented as nodes and transportation routes as edges, with weights representing travel costs.
- **Route Finding**: Implements algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s for finding the shortest and cheapest routes between cities.
- **Cost Calculation**: Calculates the total cost of travel based on selected routes and transportation methods.
- **Flexible Connections**: Supports various modes of transportation (e.g., bus, train, flight) with customizable costs.
- **Interactive Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface to input cities, view routes, and get travel recommendations.
- **Scalable Design**: Easily extendable to include more cities and transportation options due to its modular architecture.
